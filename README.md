# Live-Entity
`live-entity` is my attempt to factor out a lot of the boilerplate
around storing entities and watching them for changes. It's agnostic
to the backing storage technology. I'll elaborate more as I work on
this, but it's currently very early-stage.

## Contribution
I'm still working out the exact scope this project will aim for, so I'm definitely
open to suggestions, but I suggest logging an issue first so we can discuss it,
and I can prevent you from wasting time on something I'm unlikely to accept.
